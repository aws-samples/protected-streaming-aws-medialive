# Protecting live media streams with VPC endpoints and API Gateway

AWS helps broadcasters and content owners automate their media supply chain, streamline content distribution, and broadcast live content cost-effectively to a global audience. With AWS, you have the flexibility to scale your infrastructure as needed while only paying for the resources you use. This empowers you to build highly available and budget-friendly solutions for live video streaming. Additionally, many customers express the need to enhance control and privacy for their internal content, while still granting access to employees and third parties. This includes scenarios like internal conferences, or sharing test footage of new products, movies, and games. 

This implementation offers a modification to the [Live Streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/live-streaming-on-aws/) on AWS solution. While similar, it provides additional security measures to manage stream access and keep those streams within a private IP network, and does not use the public internet for media asset delivery.
